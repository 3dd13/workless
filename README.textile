h1. Workless

This is an addon for delayed_job (2.1.0.pre2) http://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job/tree/v2.1.0.pre2 
It is designed to be used when you're using Heroku as a host and have the need to do background work with delayed job but you dont want to leave the workers running all the time as it costs money.

You basically add the gem to your project and the rest is taken care of for you given a few CONFIG vars set on Heroku.

There are already a few of these out there, notably @mtravers' cheepnis http://github.com/mtravers/cheepnis and the autoscale branch of delayed_job by @pedro http://github.com/pedro/delayed_job/tree/autoscaling

This one takes bits from both and is helping me understand gem and plugin development. It's built for rails 3 on the delayed_job 2.1.0.pre2 tag but don't see why it wouldn't work on rails 2 as well as it hooks into the callbacks of the Delayed::Job ActiveRecord class to turn workers on and off based on the creation and destruction of jobs.

h2. Installation

Add the gem to your Gemfile

h2. Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
